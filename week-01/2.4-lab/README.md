## Introduction

This lab will give us practice writing functions using `if/else` and `loops`.

#### Requirements

Write a set of functions that:
1. takes a movie and returns `True` if its IMDB score is above 5.5
2. returns a sublist of movies with an IMDB score above 5.5
3. takes a category and returns a list of movies for that category
4. takes a list of movies and computes their average IMDB score.
5. (**Bonus**) takes a category and returns the average IMDB
